# Traffic-Detection-in-Hairpin-Turns
This project  is based on the basic Traffic Lights used in the streets of the country but we will be using advanced Sensors to detect vehicle and warn the driver on the other side. There will be some implementation constraints due to this product being implemented in hilly terrain.
